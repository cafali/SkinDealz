## SkinDealz Extension:

SkinDealz is a browser extension aimed at simplifying deal-hunting in various gaming markets, particularly on the LIVE market. By holding the SHIFT key while adding items to your CART, SkinDealz automates the purchasing process, reducing the time to under 2900ms for the entire procedure.

> [!CAUTION]
> On July 16, 2025, the Counter-Strike 2 update introduced a new Steam feature that allows users to reverse trades within 7 days. This means that if someone lists a skin for too low a price by mistake, they can simply cancel the trade during that period and recover the item.  Because of this, Skinport now only allows tradable items (those not subject to the 7-day reversal window) to be listed for sale. As a result, the SkinDealz Extension is no longer effective on the Live market, where it previously helped users quickly grab freshly listed, underpriced skins.
>
>Due to these changes, the extension has now been made public and will likely no longer be actively supported or maintained.
